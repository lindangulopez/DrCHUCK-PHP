  	<div>
	<p>If you want to write semantic code <strong>it is important that you understand these differences:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    	<li> The <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">i element </span> was for italic text, now it is also for alternate text, such as foreign words, technical terms, or inline stage directions </li> 
    	<!-- <li>for example: <i class="dadJOKE">Inline stage directions, Dad Jokes:<a href ="https://www.thedad.com/75-hilarious-quotes-about-dads-and-being-a-father/"> Number 24</a></i></li>
		<li><b class="child">RODNEY DANGERFIELD: </b> I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to my father.</li>
		<li><b class="father">MR DANGERFIELD: </b>Can I get more proof?</li> -->
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"><em> So, for alternate accentuation:</em></a> use the <em>em</em>, not the italic element.</li>
<!-- 		<li>Also the <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">em element </span>which was for emphasis, is now used for words or sentences you would pronounce differently</li> -->
		<!-- <li>The greeting was styled with the French language tag:<i><span style="color:orange;font-weight:bold"> Bonjour, de Paris! </span></i> which means <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold"> Hello from Paris!</span> was written inside a h1 tag.</li> -->
		<li>As the <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">b  element </span> is no longer used for bold text, now it is also used as a stylistic offset such as keywords in a document of product names like above.</li>
<!-- 		<li><b class="father">MR DANGERFIELD: </b> and <b class="child">RODNEY DANGERFIELD: </b></li>
		<li><h2>You should use h1, h2, ... h6 tags to make bold without CSS.</h2></li>
		<li>Aso the <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">strong element </span>is for something with strong emphasis, it represents importance like here:</li>
		<li>The phrase <b>element</b> is a keyword in this document</li> -->
    </ul>

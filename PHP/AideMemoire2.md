Why is it important to have extensive error checking on SQL statements when an application is in production?

    - Tracebacks make your application look bad

    - The developer/production team needs good detail on any errors

    - Users will rarely report errors and never give enough detail

    - Some errors are subtle and only show up very rarely


What is the purpose of the PDO::errorinfo() data?
    - It gives extended detail when a PDO function returns an error

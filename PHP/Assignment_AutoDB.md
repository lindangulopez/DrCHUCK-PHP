General Specifications

Here are some general specifications for this assignment:

You must use the PHP PDO database layer for this assignment. If you use the "mysql_" library routines or "mysqli" 
routines to access the database, you will receive a zero on this assignment.
Your name must be in the title tag of the HTML for all of the pages for this assignment.
Your program must be resistant to HTML Injection attempts. All data that comes from the users must be properly 
escaped using the htmlentities() function in PHP. You do not need to escape text that is generated by your program.
Your program must be resistant to SQL Injection attempts. This means that you should never concatenate user provided 
data with SQL to produce a query. You should always use a PDO prepared statement.
Please do not use HTML5 in-browser data validation (i.e. type="number") for the fields in this assignment as we want to
make sure you can properly do server side data validation. And in general, even when you do client-side data validation, 
you should still validate data on the server in case the user is using a non-HTML5 browser.

Databases and Tables Required for the Assignment

You already should have a PHP hosting environment such as MAMP or XAMPP installed or have some other access to a MySQL 
client to run commands.

You will need to create a database, a user to connect to the database and a password for that user using commands similar 
to the following:

{
create database misc;
GRANT ALL ON misc.* TO 'fred'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'zap';
GRANT ALL ON misc.* TO 'fred'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'zap';
}

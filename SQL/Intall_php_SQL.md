Week 1: Installing PHP and SQL
"The Missing Link" Textbook Chapter: 1, 3, 4, 37, 39, 41
Installation Handouts

In this page, you will install a programmer text editor, install a bundled all-in-one PHP/MySql application, and explore that application briefly.

We have separate pages for each of the commonly used Operating Systems:

    Setting up the MAMP PHP/MySql Environment on a Macintosh
    Setting up the MAMP PHP/MySql Environment on a Windows
    Setting up the XAMPP PHP/MySql Environment in Microsoft Windows

You can use any software you like - I d most of my demos using MAMP on the Macintosh so using MAMP might be easier on Windows. If you encounter a problem getting MAMP to work on Windows, it is OK to use XAMPP.

Note - You only need to install one of MAMP or XAMPP. Do not install both as they use the same port settings. They are both all-in-one installers for the same thing - Apache Web Server, MySQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin.

Installation Handouts

In this page, you will install a programmer text editor, install a bundled all-in-one PHP/MySql application, and explore that application briefly.

We have separate pages for each of the commonly used Operating Systems:
- [Setting up the MAMP PHP/MySql Environment on a Macintosh](https://www.wa4e.com/software-mac.php)
- [Setting up the MAMP PHP/MySql Environment on a Windows](https://www.wa4e.com/software-mamp.php)
- [Setting up the XAMPP PHP/MySql Environment in Microsoft Windows](https://www.wa4e.com/software-win.php)

#### Assignment: 

You can use any software you like - I d most of my demos using MAMP on the Macintosh so using MAMP might be easier on Windows. If you encounter a problem getting MAMP to work on Windows, it is OK to use XAMPP.

Note - You only need to install one of MAMP or XAMPP. Do not install both as they use the same port settings. They are both all-in-one installers for the same thing - Apache Web Server, MySQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin.

1. Navigate to the phpMyAdmin application select the "SQL" tab and type

2. SELECT 'January 3, 2017'

3. Replace the example date with the current date, press the "GO" button and then take a screen shot of the resulting page.

4. Following the instructions in the installation documents, make sure that display_errors = On in your php.ini file. Make the screen shot to show you did it as follows:

5.1. For MAMP, go to the phpinfo page in your environment and scroll down until you can take a screen shot showing that your php.ini is correct and take a screen shot
5.2. For XAMPP, go to Apache / Config and open the php.ini file and scroll down to show that display_errors = On and take a screen shot.
5.4. For Linux, use any editor to open your php.ini file and take a screen shot showing display_errors = On.

6. Turn those two screen shots in the peer-graded assignment in the: Peer Graded: Installing PHP/MySQL link.
